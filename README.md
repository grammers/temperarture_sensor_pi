# Temperature sensor

These is a implementation of a one wire temperature sensor.
Temperature is provided to arrowhead.
The arrowhead part uses thees

It also need a connection to an Arrowhead core.
It is tricky to run that on a pi.
The pis memory is not enough for the entire core.
You would haw to only run the bare essentials.
